    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, in the modern era, children are being raised with too much access to the internet and online platforms, and it has now become an integral part of every child’s life. The internet offers a wealth of educational resources and opportunities, but along with the benefits come risks. Risks such as cyberbullying, online predators, exposure to inappropriate content, and harmful ideologies. A child’s first line of defense should be their parents, but not all parents have the time or abilities to balance work and to monitor their children. This leads them to grant their children the freedom to explore the digital world without any restrictions or monitoring.

        This situation places immense pressure on parents, who often feel overwhelmed by the volume of digital content their child consumes and the rapid pace of technological change. Many parents lack the digital literacy necessary to guide their children, creating a gap in their ability to understand and mitigate online risks. Furthermore, the demands of modern work life frequently leave parents with limited time and energy to engage in meaningful conversations about online safety. This can lead to a sense of helplessness, as parents struggle to keep up with their children's digital activities. The constant evolution of online platforms and apps also presents a challenge, requiring parents to continuously learn and adapt. Some parents may also be hesitant to impose restrictions, fearing that they will alienate their children or hinder their access to valuable educational resources. Ultimately, the responsibility falls heavily on parents to bridge this digital divide, but they often lack the support and resources needed to do so effectively.
